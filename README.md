# Kibana UI framework

[elastic.github.io/kibana-ui-framework](https://elastic.github.io/kibana-ui-framework)

This framework exposes Angular components and SCSS styles. You can use these
components to build Kibana plugins more quickly, and be assured that your
plugin's UI will fit into the overall Kibana UI.

# Development

* Install node modules `npm install`
* Start development server `npm start`
* Deploy to GitHub Pages `npm run deploy`

# Production

In production we can either run the development server, or serve the assets statically.

* To build the assets run `npm run build` and serve static assets from `/build`
